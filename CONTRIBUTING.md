## Adding Fonts
Guidelines for Fonts Submission

- **Quality**: Only include clean, properly named font files. Avoid duplicates or broken/incomplete files.  
- **File Formats**: Only `.ttf` and `.otf` files are allowed.
- **Licensing**: Only share fonts that are free to use, open source, or clearly licensed for redistribution.
- **Font Completeness**: Do **not** submit unfinished fonts. Fonts must include all basic letters and at least the numbers `0â€“9`.  
  - It's okay if some symbols (like `/` or `@`) are missing, but the font should feel usable and complete.  
- **Category Folders**: Place each font in the folder that best fits its style (e.g., `Sans Serif`, `Monospace`, `Display`, etc.).
